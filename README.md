PDS4 Processing Information Local Data Dictionary (LDD)

## Versions (Source)

- [1.D.0.0](src/)

## Builds

A Local Data Dictionary (LDD) is built for each version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/).
The build process insures compatiblity of the LDD with the core information model.

This LDD has been built for the following versions of the PDS4 information model.

- [1.D.0.0](build/1.D.0.0/)

## Notes

Each build is generating using the [lddtool](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/software/ldd/) specific to a version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/). 

```
lddtool.bat -lpsnJ PDS4_PROC_IngestLDD.xml
```

Documentation included in the source (src) directory is generated using the "pds-ldd-doc" tool in the [pds4-tools](https://github.com/nasa-pds/pds4-tools) package.

After a build the README.md files are updated (manually) to reflect the content of repository.
